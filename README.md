HxCShards
==================
###Fan continuation of original Soul Shards from ShadwDrgn. Based on the source code of Moze_Intel, forked from SgtPunishment, and rewritten by HxCKDMS

######If you think any of this code or textures is yours, and have evidence to back it up, just submit and issue and I will change that immediately.
######Most of this code was changed from the original, since it was mostly broken. The actual version I grabbed was at this (https://github.com/TehNut/Soul-Shards-The-Old-Ways/commit/5ba4cd942faf4f27abf773b3e517325d9631555e commit)
######It was terribly written not working code, that crashed on servers, did not work as advertised and had garbage in it (Soul Shards the OLD ways not SAOCraft...)
